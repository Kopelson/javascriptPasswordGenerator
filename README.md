## Usage
A person needing to generate a password can use the generate password button.
### Modal
    When generate password is pressed a modal appears to collect user password criteria.
    
### Length
    A slider is used to collect the amount of characters the user needs the password to be. The password generator can create a password that ranges from 8 to 128 characters.
    
### Options
    The password generator can use different character types including lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. The options are selected through the checkboxs in the password criteria modal.

    When the saved button in modal is pressed the password is then generated and printed to the page. If no criteria is selected and/or the close button is pressed the password generator prints an empty password to the screen.
